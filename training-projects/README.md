# 🛠️ Power BI Training Projects

This folder contains personal and self-practice projects I created to sharpen my Power BI skills.  
Each project was built with a focus on a different topic.

## 📚 Purpose

These projects are not part of a course or certification.  
Instead, they reflect my independent learning, exploration, and experimentation with:

- Power Query
- Data Modeling
- DAX Measures
- Interactive Report Design
- Storytelling through Visuals

## 📝 Notes

- All data used in these projects is fictional or generated for learning purposes.
- Each project is stored in its own folder with a dedicated README and PBIX file.
